# Requirements

* Python 2.7.x
* Probably a working C compiler and `make` (to build libsass)


# Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:labhackercd/wikilegis.git
$ cd wikilegis
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Database and superuser setup

```bash
$ ./manage.py migrate
$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
```


# Running the development server

```bash
$ ./manage.py runserver
```


# Admin interface

If everything went right, the admin interface is now available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin. You can log in using the superuser credentials you just created and manage all kinds of contents. Once you're done managing your site, go visit the main page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
